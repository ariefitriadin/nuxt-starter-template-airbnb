# PLUGINS

This directory contains your Javascript plugins that you want to run before instantiating the root vue.js application.

More information about the usage of this directory in the documentation:
https://nuxtjs.org/guide/plugins

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

If you want to gain access to modules managed by NuxtJS, for example `vue`, you'll need to:

  ```
  import Vue from 'vue'; // eslint-disable-line import/no-extraneous-dependencies
  ```
